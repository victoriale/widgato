        "raw_article_content": "Driving the Lancer Driving Impressions The Mitsubishi Lancer has always been on the sportier side compared to more well-known competitors like the Toyota Corolla and Nissan...... Sentra, and that remains true. While the base 2.0-liter engine is rather anemic, the more recommendable 168-horsepower 2.4-liter moves the Lancer better than expected. All 2.4-liter models come with a selectable All Wheel Control system that lets you choose between front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD) for better traction on slippery roads. The Lancer is moderately fun in corners and its continuously variable automatic transmission does a decent job mimicking a conventional automatic. But more flingable fun can be had in a Mazda3, and a Honda Civic's CVT feels more natural. Unfortunately the Lancer still uses a tilt-only steering wheel. Without the ability to telescope, it can compromise driving position. Outward visibility is good, but interior noise levels remind you you're in a dated compact car. Favorite Features ROCKFORD FOSGATE SOUND SYSTEM This 9-speaker, 710-watt audio system available in a package brings some much-needed premium-quality fare to the 2017 Lancer. It also sounds really good. ALL-WHEEL CONTROLMitsubishi calls the Lancer\u2019s electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system All-Wheel Control. It includes a mode selector for front-wheel drive, all-wheel-drive \"Auto\" or all-wheel-drive \"Lock,\" to maintain optimum traction in all kinds of weather or driving conditions. It is now standard on all 2.4-liter Lancer models. 2017 Mitsubishi Lancer Details Interior Even in top form, the 2017 Lancer's 5-passenger interior is pretty drab and dated. Hard plastics, minimal controls and a steering wheel that doesn't even telescope are what you'll have to live with in Mitsubishi's small sedan. Among the few bright spots is the now-standard 6.1-inch touch-screen display that controls audio functions and the optional navigation system. We hope you like black, as that's the only interior color available, whether you go with the standard cloth seating or available leather. The rear seat folds in a 60\/40-split for added cargo flexibility. Exterior The Mitsubishi's exterior style is among its best attributes. Despite its age, this small sedan still looks sharp with its nose-down, tail-up sporty stance. We especially like these when outfitted with a rear spoiler -- don't worry, it\u2019s far more subtle than the boy-racer wing festooned on past Evos. Base models of the 2017 Lancer roll on new 16-inch 2-tone alloy wheels, while higher models get 18-inch alloy wheels. Top-line SEL models have a chrome beltline. Notable Equipment Standard Equipment In its most basic form, as a Lancer 2.0 ES, this Mitsubishi sedan now comes better equipped for 2017 with standard features like a 6.1-inch touch-screen audio display, rearview camera, alloy wheels, Fuse Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity and 4-speaker AM\/FM\/CD audio system with HD Radio and USB input. All Lancers include seven airbags and traction\/stability-control systems. Of note is Mitsubishi's warranty, which covers 10 years\/100,000 miles for the powertrain, a fully transferrable 5-year\/60,000-mile basic warranty, and five years\/unlimited miles of roadside assistance. Optional Equipment Stepping up to a 2.4-liter Lancer brings the larger, more powerful and more recommendable engine, automatic transmission, and all-wheel-drive system. SE and SEL models have sport-tuned suspension, heated front seats and upgraded audio system, while topline SEL models come with leather interior, rain-sensing windshield wipers and automatic headlights. The Lancer's lone major package, called \"Sun & Sound,\" includes a sunroof and the premium Rockford Fosgate audio system. A navigation system is also available, as are rear parking sensors and roof-rack crossbars. Under the Hood The latest Lancer is available with just two engines, and only one of them is really recommendable. Base models use a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that puts out a just-adequate 148 horsepower. The more recommendable choice is the 168-horsepower 2.4-liter. For 2017, all 2.0-liter models are front-wheel drive (FWD), while all 2.4-liter versions are all-wheel drive (AWD). A manual transmission is used only in the base 2.0 model. All others use a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Note: As with other 2017 cars, the Lancer's fuel-economy ratings are slightly lower this year due to a change in EPA testing. 2.0-liter inline-4 148 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 145 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 24\/33 mpg (manual), 27\/34 mpg (automatic) 2.4-liter inline-4 168 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 167 lb-ft of torque @ 4,100 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 23\/30 mpg Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions. Pricing Notes The 2017 Mitsubishi Lancer has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) around $18,630 for an ES 2.0 model with the 5-speed manual transmission. Adding an automatic transmission is another $1,000. At the top of the Lancer lineup, an SEL model is just under $23,000 and can climb another few thousand with a navigation system and the sunroof\/audio package. These prices are certainly enticing, but in reality aren't that far below better rivals like the Honda Civic or Mazda3. In the case of the Hyundai Elantra and Kia Forte, which are fresher, more efficient and match Mitsubishi's 10-year\/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, those competitors start for less than the less-recommendable Lancer. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Mitsubishi. As you've probably surmised, the Lancer's resale value is yet another area in which it trails the competition. To find out what consumers are really paying for this vehicle, first select a style to see the Fair Purchase Price| Calculate payments for this vehicle To compare current market prices, check out KBB.com's car classifieds to view the new and used Mitsubishi Lancer vehicles for sale near you.",

One of the few small-crossover SUVs available with a third row, the new Outlander is offered in four trim levels, ES, SE, SEL and GT, each available with all-wheel drive for an additional $2,000. Prices start under $25,000 for a front-wheel-drive ES with a 166-horsepower 4-cylinder engine, although the better-equipped SE is only $1,000 more. The GT model starts around $33,000 and gets a 224-horsepower 3.0-liter V6 and standard all-wheel drive. The new Outlander competes with the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue, Dodge Journey, Kia Sorento and Toyota RAV4. (The Outlander Sport is reviewed separately.) You'll Like This Car If... Families looking for a small SUV that seats seven, has earned a Top Safety Pick+ safety rating from the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety, offers a class-leading warranty, a long list of safety and infotainment features and has a starting price under $25,000 will like the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander. You May Not Like This Car If... Although the new 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander offers seating for seven, its 3rd-row bench is extremely small and doesn\u2019t really accommodate adults. Also, Mitsubishi\u2019s reliability ratings aren\u2019t exactly class-leading, and the very popular Honda CR-V and Nissan Rogue have traditionally held their values much better than the Outlander. What's New for 2018 For 2018 a 7-inch touch screen and a rearview camera are standard on every Mitsubishi Outlander. Blind Spot Warning, Lane Change Assist, Rear Cross Traffic Alert and a Remote Power Tailgate have been added to the SEL trim. The Outlander GT gets a standard multi-view camera and heated steering wheel. Driving It Driving Impressions With 166 horsepower, the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander has about the same amount of power as a Nissan Rogue, but quite a bit less than a Honda CR-V. The 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine is backed by an excellent CVT automatic transmission, and delivers surprisingly strong off-the-line acceleration and up to 30 mpg out on the highway. Unfortunately, those who haul a full complement of passengers and cargo won\u2019t be impressed by the 4-cylinder\u2019s passing power or uphill climbing ability. For these situations, the GT model\u2019s much more powerful V6 and 6-speed automatic transmission are indispensable. The V6 also offers more grunt off the line and comes with the more advanced all-wheel-drive (AWD) system. Unfortunately, unlike the 4-cylinder, it requires more expensive premium fuel. On the road, we found the new Outlander\u2019s ride on the firm side, its steering somewhat numb on-center and its handling acceptable, but still not on par with the Mazda CX-5. Favorite Features FORWARD-COLLISION MITIGATION If this system determines a frontal collision with another car or pedestrian is imminent, it will warn the driver and automatically apply the brakes to reduce the severity of the collision or avoid the impact all together.

The unique perspective shows you what\u2019s behind the vehicle and makes parking the SUV a lot easier. 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander Details Interior The new 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander comes standard with seating for seven. Seat comfort is very good, the materials are nice, the design is clean and the interior is pleasantly quiet. Controls are easy to use, and attractive dark bamboo-like accents give the interior a premium feel, as does the new black-gloss finish on the center floor console. Flipping and folding the second row is easy thanks to a system of straps and levers and it offers easy entrance to the very small third row. Fold down both rows and you create over 63 cubic feet of cargo space. Exterior Simple and understated, the design of the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander doesn\u2019t stand out in a class that includes the more aggressively styled Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. Still, the Mitsubishi\u2019s look is clean and attractive, with a BMW-like character line down it flanks and an angular nose that hints of the Lexus NX SUV. Cool features include the electric windshield-wiper de-icer that helps keep ice and snow from building up on the wipers, while power-folding side mirrors and standard 18-inch wheels and tires add an upscale feel. The Outlander\u2019s lack of a clumsy roof rack also adds to its sleek profile. Notable Equipment Standard Equipment The 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander is available in four trims: ES, SE, SEL and GT. Base ES models come with a 7-inch touch screen, rearview camera, automatic climate control, keyless entry, Bluetooth, heated side mirrors and 18-inch alloy wheels. The SE adds dual-climate control, heated front seats and push-button start. The SEL comes with Blind Spot Warning, Lane Change Assist, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, a Remote Power Tailgate, leather and a power driver's seat. GT models add S-AWC (Super All-Wheel Control) and a V6 engine, a Rockford Fosgate audio system, auto on-off headlights, power-folding mirrors, rain-sensing wipers and paddle shifters. Optional Equipment Among the impressive options available in the 2018 Outlander are its forward-collision-mitigation system, adaptive cruise control and lane-departure warning, three advanced safety features that can help prevent an accident. Thankfully, you don't have to buy a pricier top-end GT model to obtain these features -- they\u2019re available in the mid-level SEL trim, bundled in the Touring Package. The $4,000 package also includes rain-sensing windshield wipers, windshield-wiper de-icer, the Rockford Fosgate audio system, power-folding side mirrors, auto on-off headlights, a power tailgate, a heated steering wheel and power sunroof. All-wheel drive is a $2,000 option on ES, SE and SEL trim levels. Under the Hood The 2018 Outlander ES, SE and SEL models use a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 166 horsepower and powers either the front wheels (FWD) or all four (AWD). The SE gets a new, simplified AWD system, while all others use Mitsubishi\u2019s Super-All Wheel Control (S-AWC) setup. The 2.4-liter engine runs on regular-grade gasoline and has a towing capacity of 1,500 pounds. The Outlander GT uses a 3.0-liter V6 engine that makes 224 horsepower and comes standard with S-AWC. That more powerful engine requires more expensive premium gasoline and has a towing capacity of up to 3,500 pounds. All Outlanders are equipped with automatic transmissions, either a CVT in 4-cylinder versions or a 6-speed automatic when equipped with the V6.2.4-liter inline-4 (ES, SE, SE S-AWC, SEL, SEL S-AWC) 166 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 162 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 25\/30 mpg (FWD), 24\/29 mpg (AWD)3.0-liter V6 (GT) 224 horsepower @ 6,250 rpm 215 lb-ft of torque @ 3,750 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 20\/27 mpg Pricing Notes The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of a base 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander ES starts just under $25,000. Better-equipped SE models start around $26,000, the SEL starts around $27,000 and the V6-powered GT trims starts closer to $32,500. A top-of-the-line Outlander GT with the Touring package and every option can reach nearly $40,000. Compared with the Outlander's closest competitor, the Kia Sorento, the Mitsubishi's starting price is nearly $2,000 less. The larger Dodge Journey, meanwhile, starts around $22,250 -- but a third row of seats costs extra. Before buying, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the 2018 Outlander. In resale value, the Outlander has traditionally held up well with residuals on par with or even better than the Sorento, better than the Dodge Journey, but below 5-passenger crossover SUVs like the Mazda CX-5 and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport.

        "html_stripped_content": "Driving the Outlander Driving Impressions With 166 horsepower, the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander has about the same amount of power as a Nissan Rogue, but quite a bit less than a Honda CR-V. The 2.4-liter 4-cylinder...... engine is backed by an excellent CVT automatic transmission, and delivers surprisingly strong off-the-line acceleration and up to 30 mpg out on the highway. Unfortunately, those who haul a full complement of passengers and cargo won\u2019t be impressed by the 4-cylinder\u2019s passing power or uphill climbing ability. For these situations, the GT model\u2019s much more powerful V6 and 6-speed automatic transmission are indispensable. The V6 also offers more grunt off the line and comes with the more advanced all-wheel-drive (AWD) system. Unfortunately, unlike the 4-cylinder, it requires more expensive premium fuel. On the road, we found the new Outlander\u2019s ride on the firm side, its steering somewhat numb on-center and its handling acceptable, but still not on par with the Mazda CX-5. Favorite Features FORWARD-COLLISION MITIGATION If this system determines a frontal collision with another car or pedestrian is imminent, it will warn the driver and automatically apply the brakes to reduce the severity of the collision or avoid the impact all together. This system is optional on the SEL and GT trim levels. MULTI-VIEW CAMERA SYSTEMMitsubishi offers a long list of active and passive safety systems on the new 2018 Outlander, including this smart system, which provides an overhead bird\u2019s-eye view of the vehicle and its surrounds. The unique perspective shows you what\u2019s behind the vehicle and makes parking the SUV a lot easier. 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander Details Interior The new 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander comes standard with seating for seven. Seat comfort is very good, the materials are nice, the design is clean and the interior is pleasantly quiet. Controls are easy to use, and attractive dark bamboo-like accents give the interior a premium feel, as does the new black-gloss finish on the center floor console. Flipping and folding the second row is easy thanks to a system of straps and levers and it offers easy entrance to the very small third row. Fold down both rows and you create over 63 cubic feet of cargo space. Exterior Simple and understated, the design of the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander doesn\u2019t stand out in a class that includes the more aggressively styled Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. Still, the Mitsubishi\u2019s look is clean and attractive, with a BMW-like character line down it flanks and an angular nose that hints of the Lexus NX SUV. Cool features include the electric windshield-wiper de-icer that helps keep ice and snow from building up on the wipers, while power-folding side mirrors and standard 18-inch wheels and tires add an upscale feel. The Outlander\u2019s lack of a clumsy roof rack also adds to its sleek profile. Notable Equipment Standard Equipment The 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander is available in four trims: ES, SE, SEL and GT. Base ES models come with a 7-inch touch screen, rearview camera, automatic climate control, keyless entry, Bluetooth, heated side mirrors and 18-inch alloy wheels. The SE adds dual-climate control, heated front seats and push-button start. The SEL comes with Blind Spot Warning, Lane Change Assist, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, a Remote Power Tailgate, leather and a power driver's seat. GT models add S-AWC (Super All-Wheel Control) and a V6 engine, a Rockford Fosgate audio system, auto on-off headlights, power-folding mirrors, rain-sensing wipers and paddle shifters. Optional Equipment Among the impressive options available in the 2018 Outlander are its forward-collision-mitigation system, adaptive cruise control and lane-departure warning, three advanced safety features that can help prevent an accident. Thankfully, you don't have to buy a pricier top-end GT model to obtain these features -- they\u2019re available in the mid-level SEL trim, bundled in the Touring Package. The $4,000 package also includes rain-sensing windshield wipers, windshield-wiper de-icer, the Rockford Fosgate audio system, power-folding side mirrors, auto on-off headlights, a power tailgate, a heated steering wheel and power sunroof. All-wheel drive is a $2,000 option on ES, SE and SEL trim levels. Under the Hood The 2018 Outlander ES, SE and SEL models use a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 166 horsepower and powers either the front wheels (FWD) or all four (AWD). The SE gets a new, simplified AWD system, while all others use Mitsubishi\u2019s Super-All Wheel Control (S-AWC) setup. The 2.4-liter engine runs on regular-grade gasoline and has a towing capacity of 1,500 pounds. The Outlander GT uses a 3.0-liter V6 engine that makes 224 horsepower and comes standard with S-AWC. That more powerful engine requires more expensive premium gasoline and has a towing capacity of up to 3,500 pounds. All Outlanders are equipped with automatic transmissions, either a CVT in 4-cylinder versions or a 6-speed automatic when equipped with the V6.2.4-liter inline-4 (ES, SE, SE S-AWC, SEL, SEL S-AWC) 166 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 162 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 25\/30 mpg (FWD), 24\/29 mpg (AWD)3.0-liter V6 (GT) 224 horsepower @ 6,250 rpm 215 lb-ft of torque @ 3,750 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 20\/27 mpg Pricing Notes The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of a base 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander ES starts just under $25,000. Better-equipped SE models start around $26,000, the SEL starts around $27,000 and the V6-powered GT trims starts closer to $32,500. A top-of-the-line Outlander GT with the Touring package and every option can reach nearly $40,000. Compared with the Outlander's closest competitor, the Kia Sorento, the Mitsubishi's starting price is nearly $2,000 less.

        "raw_article_content": "Driving the Mirage Driving Impressions Our 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 sedan exhibited a smooth ride and strong brakes. Unfortunately, the steering\u2019s on-center feel is so poor we physically had to...... return the wheel to center or run the risk of continuing in whichever direction the Mirage was last pointed. On rough pavement, the Mirage\u2019s suspension is quite bouncy and the car leans heavily even in moderate corners. Fuel economy is good so long as you\u2019re not in a hurry to get where you\u2019re going. Any sense of urgency, however, requires constant full-throttle maneuvers that quickly torpedo those rosy EPA numbers. The 1.2-liter 3-cylinder engine isn\u2019t big on power; with a mere 78 ponies it requires a leisurely 12.5 seconds to achieve 60 mph. The engine is also quite loud at full throttle, a fact exacerbated by the CVT automatic transmission that keeps the tachometer near redline anytime the engine is asked for peak performance. Favorite Features APPLE CARPLAY\/ANDROID AUTO A pleasant surprise in any subcompact, the 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage offers both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. With these apps, the audio system connects to your smartphone allowing you to access texts, maps and music all via the 6.5-inch touch screen. WARRANTY Similar to what Hyundai and Kia offer, Mitsubishi\u2019s 2018 Mirage and Mirage G4 subcompacts come with a 5-year\/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and a 10-year\/100,000-mile powertrain warranty at no extra cost. 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage Details Interior Improvements to the interior this year include a new touch-screen audio system, rearview camera and a relocated USB port. Sadly, soft-touch surfaces aren\u2019t among the positive, and the Mirage offers no padded elbow rest, although it does gain a driver\u2019s-side center armrest this year. The supportive seat padding and cloth suggest comfort, and the seat heaters are remarkably efficient, but the lousy seating position makes it hard to actually get comfortable. And there are cheap touches everywhere, like the Bluetooth microphone gracelessly tacked on top of the steering column. Exterior While we wouldn't call the 2018 Mirage ugly, it doesn't benefit from the cutesy charm of some other jelly-bean-like subcompacts. The hatchback and sedan feature a large chrome grille with a handsomely detailed lower bumper. The trunk gives the little car a more mature persona, and while it offers decent cargo space, the rear seats don't fold down as they do in the hatch, although there is a pass-through for longer objects. The Mirage G4 is available in a few eye-catching colors, such as bright orange Infrared, or the purplish Wine Red of our test car. Notable Equipment Standard Equipment The basic 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 comes with air conditioning, tilt (but not telescoping) steering wheel with controls for audio and Bluetooth, and power windows, doors and mirrors. Also standard is keyless entry with an alarm, a USB port, and a 4-speaker touch-screen audio system with rearview camera. It's a little sparse, but not surprising considering the low base price. Safety features include hill-start assist, seven standard airbags, including a driver's-side knee airbag, and stability control. That of course is on top of the 1.2-liter 3-cylinder engine, which in base models is paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Optional Equipment Foremost among the options is the automatic transmission, which we recommend since the manual is hardly the best. Most options are available as standard equipment in the higher-level SE trim on sedans, or GT on the hatchback. They include push-button ignition and entry, and the upgraded audio system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Automatic climate control is also part of the upgraded models, but curiously a stand-alone navigation system isn't available; presumably Mitsubishi has decided whatever smartphone you're using will suffice. Also available on the SE\/GT models is cruise control controlled through steering-wheel buttons. Under the Hood The only engine available in the 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage and Mirage G4 is a 1.2-liter 3-cylinder with a modest 78 horsepower. The engine's primary duty is saving fuel, and it does this admirably, offering up to 42 mpg on the highway and 35 mpg in the city, numbers we normally associate with hybrids. The downside is that this isn't the most elegant powertrain. The engine vibrates noticeably at idle -- although it's better than it was before -- and at full throttle it sings a raspy, groaning song that will discourage exploring the reach of the gas pedal. Unfortunately, even if you just want to keep up with traffic leaving a stoplight, you'll need to floor it, which of course hurts fuel economy. 1.2-liter inline-3 78 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 74 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 33\/40 mpg (manual, sedan) 33\/41 mpg (manual, hatchback), 35\/42 mpg (automatic, sedan), 37\/43 mpg (automatic, hatchback) Pricing Notes The lowest Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage is on the ES hatchback, which starts at about $14,260 including the $865 destination charge. The automatic transmission adds $1,200 to that price. The G4 sedan starts at about $15,260 with a manual. A fully equipped Mirage G4 SE is automatic-only and starts at a little below $18,800. While those prices are low, they're also not much better than a variety of competitors, like the Nissan Versa or Honda Fit. No matter what you decide, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid; it's a good chance it's well below sticker.

        "raw_article_content": "Driving the i-MiEV Driving Impressions Mitsubishi\u2019s 2017 i-MiEV is the kind of electric vehicle that gives EVs a bad name. Pros are decent acceleration from a dead stop, plus quick steering and a tiny footprint...... that makes it maneuverable in parking lots. But that's about it. It takes forever to get to a 60-mph freeway speed, and once there the ride is jittery and uncomfortable. That's fine if you never go over about 40 mph and stay close to home, or at least close to a good charging network, as we found the i-MiEV's purported 62-mile range to be wildly optimistic. Not only will you need to go extremely light on the throttle, you'll have to forgo any climate controls as well...have fun on a hot or cold day. To help, the transmission offers Eco and B-modes, with the \"B\" especially helpful at slowing the car using regenerative braking when descending hills. Favorite Features PRICING The low price is far and away the best thing about the Mitsubishi i-MiEV. It undercuts the Nissan Leaf by about $6,000, and the Chevy Spark by $1,000. Deduct federal tax credits and state incentives -- $7,500 and $2,500 in California, for example -- it comes out to less than $14,000. SPACE-EFFICIENT DESIGN While we're not wowed by the looks, we have to admit there's a lot of space in this tiny car. The tall profile, big windows and hatchback design maximize space, as do the compact electric motor and battery pack placed underneath the rear seat. 2017 Mitsubishi i-MiEV Details Interior Proponents of the i-MiEV would call its interior \"purposeful,\" but we just call it cheap. The dash is drab and feels cheap, and the entire interior is awash in hard lowball-feeling plastics. The 7-inch navigation system dresses it up a little, but it's small comfort. Most EVs have a fancy instrument cluster that shows your driving habits to help you save on electrons, but the i-MiEV sticks to the basics. There's room for four, and it's surprisingly roomy-feeling thanks to the ample headroom. Just pack light, as the cargo space behind the rear seats is pretty small. Exterior \"Bubble car\" is what comes to mind when looking at the Mitsubishi i-MiEV. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you, but it's unique either way. Some might think the elongated headlights, sharply cut rear end, and balloonish shape make it \"cute.\" More cynical types see a golf cart with delusions of grandeur. Its four doors do open wide, and the high roof makes it easy to get in and out. The hatchback makes loading cargo a snap, and the 144.7-inch length means it's shorter than even a Mini Cooper Hardtop, and a breeze to park. Notable Equipment Standard Equipment The 2017 Mitsubishi i-MiEV comes in only one model -- ES -- and amenities are few. There are heated front seats, which use less energy than the heater in the heater setting on the climate control. There's also a 6-speaker\/100-watt AM\/FM\/CD audio system, keyless entry, folding rear seats and a 6-way manual-adjust driver's seat. Also standard is a Level 3 DC quick-charge port that can get the battery up to 80 percent in about 30 minutes. Optional Equipment There's only one really notable option for the 2017 Mitsubishi i-MiEV, and that's the Navigation Package. It adds a 7-inch touch-screen display to the cockpit that gives you 3D mapping, real-time traffic and points of interest. It also offers voice command, Bluetooth wireless connectivity, a USB port, and steering-wheel controls for audio, Bluetooth functions, and a rearview camera, making it worth the $2,000. Other add-ons are limited to accessories like a map light, rear parking sensors and a USB kit for iPods. Under the Hood The i-MiEV's short hood hides nothing, really, since the powerplant itself is actually behind the rear seat. Comprising an electric motor, a fixed-reduction-gear transmission and a 16 kWh lithium-ion battery (with an 8-year\/100,000-mile limited warranty), it delivers 66 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque to this little hatchback's rear wheels. Top speed is 80 mph, so short freeway trips are possible when there's enough charge. On a regular 120-volt home outlet, a full charge for the i-MiEV takes nearly a day -- 22 hours. On a 240-volt outlet, that time is cut to six hours. A public \"Level 3\" quick-charging station can charge the battery to 80 percent in about 30 minutes. AC synchronous permanent magnetic motor 16 kWh lithium-ion battery pack 66 horsepower @ 3,000-6,000 rpm 145 lb-ft of torque @ 0-300 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy equivalent: 126\/99 mpge EPA-estimated range per full charge: 62 miles Pricing Notes A 2017 Mitsubishi i-MiEV has a Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $24,000 when you include the $850 destination charge. The Navigation Package -- which we strongly recommend -- adds another $2,000. The $7,500 federal tax credit takes off a big chunk, of course, and state credits reduce prices further for those who qualify. It's the least expensive EV you can buy, some $6,000 less than the Nissan Leaf or Ford Focus EV. However, the Chevy Spark EV is nicer to drive and only about $1,000 more. Plus there are a ton of gasoline-powered alternatives for less than $20,000, such as the Honda Fit or Kia Soul. But if you're set on an i-MiEV, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid, and don't expect your i-MiEV to hold its value, as it's near the bottom of an already weak class of cars.

The tall profile, big windows and hatchback design maximize space, as do the compact electric motor and battery pack placed underneath the rear seat. 2017 Mitsubishi i-MiEV Details Interior Proponents of the i-MiEV would call its interior \"purposeful,\" but we just call it cheap. The dash is drab and feels cheap, and the entire interior is awash in hard lowball-feeling plastics. The 7-inch navigation system dresses it up a little, but it's small comfort. Most EVs have a fancy instrument cluster that shows your driving habits to help you save on electrons, but the i-MiEV sticks to the basics. There's room for four, and it's surprisingly roomy-feeling thanks to the ample headroom. Just pack light, as the cargo space behind the rear seats is pretty small. Exterior \"Bubble car\" is what comes to mind when looking at the Mitsubishi i-MiEV. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you, but it's unique either way. Some might think the elongated headlights, sharply cut rear end, and balloonish shape make it \"cute.\" More cynical types see a golf cart with delusions of grandeur. Its four doors do open wide, and the high roof makes it easy to get in and out. The hatchback makes loading cargo a snap, and the 144.7-inch length means it's shorter than even a Mini Cooper Hardtop, and a breeze to park. Notable Equipment Standard Equipment The 2017 Mitsubishi i-MiEV comes in only one model -- ES -- and amenities are few. There are heated front seats, which use less energy than the heater in the heater setting on the climate control. There's also a 6-speaker\/100-watt AM\/FM\/CD audio system, keyless entry, folding rear seats and a 6-way manual-adjust driver's seat. Also standard is a Level 3 DC quick-charge port that can get the battery up to 80 percent in about 30 minutes. Optional Equipment There's only one really notable option for the 2017 Mitsubishi i-MiEV, and that's the Navigation Package. It adds a 7-inch touch-screen display to the cockpit that gives you 3D mapping, real-time traffic and points of interest. It also offers voice command, Bluetooth wireless connectivity, a USB port, and steering-wheel controls for audio, Bluetooth functions, and a rearview camera, making it worth the $2,000. Other add-ons are limited to accessories like a map light, rear parking sensors and a USB kit for iPods. Under the Hood The i-MiEV's short hood hides nothing, really, since the powerplant itself is actually behind the rear seat. Comprising an electric motor, a fixed-reduction-gear transmission and a 16 kWh lithium-ion battery (with an 8-year\/100,000-mile limited warranty), it delivers 66 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque to this little hatchback's rear wheels. Top speed is 80 mph, so short freeway trips are possible when there's enough charge. On a regular 120-volt home outlet, a full charge for the i-MiEV takes nearly a day -- 22 hours. On a 240-volt outlet, that time is cut to six hours. A public \"Level 3\" quick-charging station can charge the battery to 80 percent in about 30 minutes. AC synchronous permanent magnetic motor 16 kWh lithium-ion battery pack 66 horsepower @ 3,000-6,000 rpm 145 lb-ft of torque @ 0-300 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy equivalent: 126\/99 mpge EPA-estimated range per full charge: 62 miles Pricing Notes A 2017 Mitsubishi i-MiEV has a Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $24,000 when you include the $850 destination charge. The Navigation Package -- which we strongly recommend -- adds another $2,000. The $7,500 federal tax credit takes off a big chunk, of course, and state credits reduce prices further for those who qualify. It's the least expensive EV you can buy, some $6,000 less than the Nissan Leaf or Ford Focus EV. However, the Chevy Spark EV is nicer to drive and only about $1,000 more. Plus there are a ton of gasoline-powered alternatives for less than $20,000, such as the Honda Fit or Kia Soul. But if you're set on an i-MiEV, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid, and don't expect your i-MiEV to hold its value, as it's near the bottom of an already weak class of cars.

        "raw_article_content": "Driving the Mirage Driving Impressions The 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage sedan and hatchback offer a comfortable highway ride for such a small car, and the brakes bring the low-mass sedan to...... a stop quickly, and with a firm pedal. Fuel economy is quite good; we saw about 38 mpg during a highway commute. Unfortunately, that's about where the good news ends. The 1.2-liter 3-cylinder engine isn't as rough at idle as it used to be, but it's still raucous at full throttle. Since the continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) keeps it near redline whenever you need extra power, you'll hear its unpleasant song a lot. Unfortunately, the noisy and leisurely acceleration aren't the end of dynamic problems. The steering's on-center feel is so bad you have to physically bring it back to center to ensure you don't just keep turning in a broad arc. The suspension bounces over larger bumps, and the Mirage leans heavily even in moderate corners. Favorite Features APPLE CARPLAY\/ANDROID AUTO We've come to appreciate the integration of our phones with our cars, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto make it as simple as possible. Just plug your phone in using a USB cable, and you can access functions like text, maps, phone and other compatible apps on the Mirage's touch-screen. WARRANTY If you do decide to go with the Mitsubishi Mirage, you'll be benefiting from one of the best warranties in the business. It covers bumper-to-bumper for five years or 60,000 miles, and the powertrain is covered for 10 years or 100,000 miles. 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage Details Interior Improvements to the interior this year include piano-black accents, an upgraded and surprisingly good infotainment system, and a few other bits of trim here and there. Sadly, soft-touch surfaces weren't among the changes, and the Mirage offers no padded elbow rest and no center armrest at all. The supportive seat padding and cloth suggest comfort, and the seat heaters are remarkably efficient, but the lousy seating position makes it hard to actually get comfortable. And there are cheap touches everywhere, like the Bluetooth microphone gracelessly tacked on top of the steering column, or the USB dongle hidden in the glove box.\u00a0 Exterior While we wouldn't call the 2017 Mirage ugly, it doesn't benefit from the cutesy charm of some other jellybean-like subcompacts. The styling changes for this year apply to the hatchback and sedan, with both getting a bigger grille with more chrome, and a more detailed lower bumper. The trunk gives the little car a more mature persona, and while it offers decent cargo space, the rear seats don't fold down for long objects like they do in the hatchback. The Mirage G4 is available in a few eye-catching colors, such as bright orange Infrared, or the purplish Wine Red of our test car. Notable Equipment Standard Equipment The basic 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 comes with air conditioning, tilt (but not telescoping) steering with electric assist, and power windows, doors and mirrors. Also standard is keyless entry with an alarm, a USB port, and a 4-speaker audio system. It's a little sparse, but not surprising considering the low base price. Safety features include hill-start assist, seven standard airbags, including a driver's-side knee airbag, and stability control. That of course is on top of the 1.2-liter 3-cylinder engine, which in base models is paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Optional Equipment Foremost among the options is the automatic transmission, which we recommend since the manual is hardly the best. Most options are available as standard equipment in the higher-level SE trim on sedans, or GT on the hatchback. They include a rearview camera, push-button ignition and entry, and the upgraded audio system that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Automatic climate control is also part of the upgraded models, but curiously a stand-alone navigation system isn't available; presumably Mitsubishi has decided whatever smartphone you're using will suffice. Also available on the SE\/GT models is cruise control and Bluetooth, both controlled through steering-wheel buttons.\u00a0 Under the Hood The only engine available in the 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 is a 1.2-liter 3-cylinder with a modest 78 horsepower, four more than last year. The engine's primary duty is saving fuel, and it does this admirably, offering up to 42 mpg on the highway and 35 mpg in the city, numbers we normally associate with hybrids. The downside is that this isn't the most elegant powertrain. The engine vibrates noticeably at idle -- although it's better than it was before -- and at full throttle it sings a raspy, groaning song that will discourage exploring the reach of the gas pedal. Unfortunately, even if you just want to keep up with traffic leaving a stoplight, you'll need to floor it, which of course hurts fuel economy. 1.2-liter inline-3 78 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 74 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 33\/40 mpg (manual, sedan) 33\/41 mpg (manual, hatchback), 35\/42 mpg (automatic, sedan), 37\/43 mpg (automatic, hatchback) Pricing Notes The lowest Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage is on the ES hatchback, which starts at about $14,000 including the $835 destination charge. The automatic transmission adds $1,200 to that price. The new G4 sedan starts at about $15,000 with a manual. A fully equipped Mirage G4 SE is automatic-only and starts at a little below $18,000. While those prices are low, they're also not much better than a variety of competitors, like the Nissan Versa or Honda Fit. No matter what you decide, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid; it's a good chance it's well below sticker.

        "raw_article_content": "Driving the Outlander Driving Impressions Mitsubishi\u2019s 2017 Outlander SUV is one of the few vehicles we\u2019d recommend with its 4-cylinder engine over the optional V6. The 2.4-liter\u2019s 166 horsepower is managed by an excellent CVT...... automatic transmission, delivering surprisingly strong off-the-line acceleration and fuel economy up to 30-mpg highway. Unfortunately, those who tow or haul a full passenger complement won\u2019t be impressed by the 4-cylinder\u2019s passing power or uphill climbing ability. For these situations, the V6\u2019s extra 40 horsepower and 53 lb-ft of torque are indispensable, although the V6\u2019s 6-speed automatic doesn\u2019t manage the extra power as well as the CVT. The V6 also comes with the more advanced AWD system and, unlike the 4-cylinder, requires premium fuel. On the road, we found the Outlander\u2019s ride on the firm side, its steering somewhat numb on-center and its handling acceptable, but still not on par with the Mazda CX-5. Favorite Features CVT8 TRANSMISSION Mitsubishi\u2019s 2017 Outlander is equipped with one of the best CVT automatics we\u2019ve ever tested. Efficient, quiet and responsive, it squeezes every drop of power from the 2.4-liter engine while returning impressive fuel economy. ADVANCED SAFETY FEATURES Along with the available adaptive cruise control, the 2017 Outlander offers rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot warning, forward-collision mitigation with pedestrian detection and lane-change assist. 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Details Interior The Mitsubishi Outlander comes standard with seating for seven, who will enjoy an even nicer cabin for 2017. Controls are easy to use, and attractive dark bamboo-like accents give the interior a more premium feel, as does the new black gloss finish on the center floor console. The materials are nice, the design is clean and the interior is pleasantly quiet. Flipping and folding the second row is now easy, thanks to a system of straps and levers. That offers easy entrance to the very small third row. Fold down both rows and you create over 63 cubic feet of cargo space. Exterior Last year\u2019s makeover carries over into 2017, with the Outlander displaying an aggressive nose and rear for a look that is unique, but isn't universally loved. The angular nose, while definitely fitting into the Mitsubishi family, also hints at the looks of the Lexus NX SUV. Cool features like the electric windshield-wiper de-icer that helps keep ice and snow from building up on the wipers, a shark-fin antenna and power-folding side mirrors add an upscale feel. Notable Equipment Standard Equipment The 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander is available in four trims: ES, SE, SEL and GT. Base ES models come with automatic climate control, keyless entry, 6-speaker touch-screen audio, rearview camera, Bluetooth, heated side mirrors and 18-inch alloy wheels. The SE adds fog lights, dual climate control, heated front seats and push-button start. The SEL comes equipped with leather seats and a power driver's seat. GT models add S-AWC (Super All-Wheel Control) and a V6 engine, a power liftgate, a 710-watt Rockford-Fosgate audio system, auto on-off headlights, power-folding mirrors, rain-sensing wipers and paddles for manual shifting. Optional Equipment Among the more impressive options available in the 2017 Outlander are its forward-collision mitigation system, adaptive cruise control and lane-departure warning, three advanced safety features that can help prevent an accident. Thankfully, you don't have to buy a pricier top-end GT model to obtain these features -- they are available in the mid-level SEL trim, bundled in the Touring Package. The package also includes navigation, rain-sensing windshield wipers, windshield-wiper de-icer, the Rockford-Fosgate audio system, power-folding side mirrors, auto on-off headlights, a power tailgate, a heated steering wheel and power sunroof. Under the Hood Outlander ES, SE and SEL models use a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 166 horsepower and powers either the front wheels or all four (FWD, AWD). The SE gets a new, simplified AWD system, while all others use Mitsubishi\u2019s Super-All Wheel Control (S-AWC) setup. The 2.4-liter engine runs on regular unleaded and has a towing capacity of 1,500 pounds. The Outlander GT uses a 3.0-liter V6 engine that makes 224 horsepower and comes standard with S-AWC. That more powerful engine uses premium gasoline and has a towing capacity of up to 3,500 pounds. All Outlanders are equipped with automatic transmissions, either a CVT in 4-cylinder versions or a 6-speed automatic when equipped with the V6. 2.4-liter inline-4 (ES, SE, SE S-AWC, SEL, SEL S-AWC) 166 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 162 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 25\/30 mpg (FWD), 24\/29 mpg (AWD) 3.0-liter V6 (GT) 224 horsepower @ 6,250 rpm 215 lb-ft of torque @ 3,750 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 20\/27 mpg Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions. Pricing Notes The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of a base 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander ES starts just under $24,400. Better-equipped SE models start below $25,400, the SEL starts at nearly $26,400 and V6-powered GT trims start closer to $32,600. A top-of-the-line Outlander GT with the Touring package and every option can reach nearly $40,000. Compared with the Outlander's closest competitor, the Kia Sorento, the Mitsubishi's starting price is nearly $2,000 less. The larger Dodge Journey, meanwhile, starts around $22,250 -- but a third row of seats costs extra. Before buying, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the 2017 Outlander. In resale value, the Outlander has traditionally held up well with residuals on par with or even better than the Sorento, better than the Dodge Journey, but below 5-passenger crossover SUVs like the Mazda CX-5 and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport.

Under the Hood Outlander ES, SE and SEL models use a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 166 horsepower and powers either the front wheels or all four (FWD, AWD). The SE gets a new, simplified AWD system, while all others use Mitsubishi\u2019s Super-All Wheel Control (S-AWC) setup. The 2.4-liter engine runs on regular unleaded and has a towing capacity of 1,500 pounds. The Outlander GT uses a 3.0-liter V6 engine that makes 224 horsepower and comes standard with S-AWC. That more powerful engine uses premium gasoline and has a towing capacity of up to 3,500 pounds. All Outlanders are equipped with automatic transmissions, either a CVT in 4-cylinder versions or a 6-speed automatic when equipped with the V6. 2.4-liter inline-4 (ES, SE, SE S-AWC, SEL, SEL S-AWC) 166 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 162 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 25\/30 mpg (FWD), 24\/29 mpg (AWD) 3.0-liter V6 (GT) 224 horsepower @ 6,250 rpm 215 lb-ft of torque @ 3,750 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 20\/27 mpg Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions. Pricing Notes The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of a base 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander ES starts just under $24,400. Better-equipped SE models start below $25,400, the SEL starts at nearly $26,400 and V6-powered GT trims start closer to $32,600. A top-of-the-line Outlander GT with the Touring package and every option can reach nearly $40,000. Compared with the Outlander's closest competitor, the Kia Sorento, the Mitsubishi's starting price is nearly $2,000 less. The larger Dodge Journey, meanwhile, starts around $22,250 -- but a third row of seats costs extra. Before buying, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the 2017 Outlander. In resale value, the Outlander has traditionally held up well with residuals on par with or even better than the Sorento, better than the Dodge Journey, but below 5-passenger crossover SUVs like the Mazda CX-5 and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport.

        "raw_article_content": "Driving the Outlander Sport Driving Impressions If Mitsubishi\u2019s 2017 Outlander Sport SUV lags behind its competition in one area, it would have to be age. While the Outlander Sport did undergo a few facelifts along the...... way, its guts have remained the same since 2011. The design must be a good one, because the Outlander Sport continues to be Mitsubishi\u2019s best-selling model. We get it. The Outlander Sport offers a very comfortable cabin neatly detailed and filled with comfort and convenience features. It offers a manual transmission on base front-wheel-drive (FWD) models, a rarity these days. It gets really good gas mileage thanks to a pair of efficient 4-cylinder engine options and an even better CVT automatic transmission. While not nearly as lively in the corners as the Mazda CX-5 or Kia Sportage, the Outlander Sport is still a very competent compact SUV, especially when equipped with the optional all-wheel-drive (AWD) system. Favorite Features ROCKFORD FOSGATE AUDIO SYSTEM The 2017 Outlander Sport SUV offers a kicking 710-watt, 9-speaker Rockford Fosgate audio upgrade guaranteed to please the music lover in all of us. Deep bass is provided by a powered sub, and the system can be paired with a 40-gigabyte music-storage hard drive. GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY While other compact SUVs offer a sub-$20,000 model, it won\u2019t come with standard auto climate control and a 10-year\/100,000-mile warranty. Even a nicely equipped top-of-the-line GT with AWD barely touches the $30,000 zone. 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport Details Interior The 2017 Outlander Sport interior offers new seat fabric on the ES trim and is complemented by piano-black accents, bright trim around the center stack and a 6.1-inch display audio system. The light-gray interior color option helps brighten up what can usually be a somber black interior at this price. The comfortable front seats are supportive over a long drive, while the rear seats are definitely for smaller adults; 6-footers will feel cramped. Behind the second row is a pretty small cargo area, offering just 20 cubic feet of space, although it opens up considerably when you fold down the rear seatbacks. Exterior There's no doubting the 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a sharp-looking little SUV. The family resemblance is most noticeable up front where the nose mimics the styling of the bigger Outlander. It\u2019s an aggressive design that looks good here. The rest of the vehicle has remained largely unchanged over the years, with the exception of molding around the wheelwells. The proportions are spot-on, and the compact size -- it's about eight inches shorter than a CR-V -- makes it easy to maneuver around tight urban parking lots. An optionally available roof rack can carry larger items that won't fit inside. Notable Equipment Standard Equipment The base Mitsubishi Outlander Sport ES offers some solid features for its roughly $20,700 price, including leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, LED taillights, automatic climate control, 18-inch alloy wheels, steering-wheel-mounted cruise control and audio buttons, a 4-speaker\/140-watt AM\/FM\/CD system, and Fuse voice-control system. A multicolor information display reads out fuel consumption, outside temperature and other data. Safety systems include hill-start assist, stability control and seven standard airbags, plus a driver's-side knee airbag. Mitsubishi vehicles also come with a new-car warranty that includes 10 years\/100,000 miles for the powertrain. Optional Equipment Skip the base 2.0-liter engine and get the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, which offers more power and torque with only a minor penalty in fuel economy. Otherwise, features get added as you work up the trim ladder. The SE model adds fog lights, push-button ignition, a rearview camera and the 6.1-inch display audio system, while the SEL takes that and adds leather seating, chrome exhaust and power-folding sideview mirrors. The top-line GT adds a panoramic glass roof, HID headlights, and the awesome Rockford Fosgate audio system. All-wheel drive is available on all models and is standard on the GT. Under the Hood The base engine in the 2017 Outlander Sport is a forgettable 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with only 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. It comes with a 5-speed manual or CVT automatic transmission, but it's overwhelmed by this little SUV, which comes in front- or all-wheel drive. Instead, get the available 2.4-liter 4-cylinder. At 168 horsepower it's no powerhouse, but it doesn't have to work as hard to get the Outlander Sport moving, so it's quieter as well as offering more punch. The continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) is the only option, but it mimics a standard transmission with \"shift\" points, and it was smooth enough. An AWD system is available on all models, offering peace of mind for slippery-road conditions. 2.0-liter inline-4 148 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 145 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 23\/29 mpg (manual), 24\/30 mpg (automatic, FWD), 23\/29 mpg (automatic, AWD) 2.4-liter inline-4 168 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 167 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 23\/28 mpg (FWD), 22\/27 mpg (AWD) Note: Due to changes in EPA testing to more effectively reflect real-world conditions, some 2017 models show slightly lower fuel-economy scores than their 2016 versions. Pricing Notes Mitsubishi holds the line on the 2017 Outlander Sport, with a front-wheel-drive base ES model starting with a reasonable $20,700 Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP), including the $850 destination charge. The new Outlander Sport SEL model starts at a little over $25,000, and the GT starts at a bit less than $28,600. AWD adds about $1,400 to any Outlander Sport model. That price undercuts the Mazda CX-5, Nissan Juke, Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Subaru Forester, Mini Cooper and even the Hyundai Tucson by hundreds to thousands of dollars. Even if you load up an Outlander Sport GT with AWD, you'll still be around the $30,000 mark. Whatever you choose, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what buyers are paying for this vehicle in your area. The downside is that the Outlander Sport is near the bottom of the class for resale value.

        "article_url": "https:\/\/www.kbb.com\/mitsubishi\/mirage-g4\/2017",
        "raw_article_content": "Driving the Mirage G4 Driving Impressions The 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage sedan and hatchback offer a comfortable highway ride for such a small car, and the brakes bring the low-mass sedan to...... a stop quickly, and with a firm pedal. Fuel economy is quite good; we saw about 38 mpg during a highway commute. Unfortunately, that's about where the good news ends. The 1.2-liter 3-cylinder engine isn't as rough at idle as it used to be, but it's still raucous at full throttle. Since the continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) keeps it near redline whenever you need extra power, you'll hear its unpleasant song a lot. Unfortunately, the noisy and leisurely acceleration aren't the end of dynamic problems. The steering's on-center feel is so bad you have to physically bring it back to center to ensure you don't just keep turning in a broad arc. The suspension bounces over larger bumps, and the Mirage leans heavily even in moderate corners. Favorite Features APPLE CARPLAY\/ANDROID AUTO We've come to appreciate the integration of our phones with our cars, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto make it as simple as possible. Just plug your phone in using a USB cable, and you can access functions like text, maps, phone and other compatible apps on the Mirage's touch-screen. WARRANTY If you do decide to go with the Mitsubishi Mirage, you'll be benefiting from one of the best warranties in the business. It covers bumper-to-bumper for five years or 60,000 miles, and the powertrain is covered for 10 years or 100,000 miles. 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 Details Interior Improvements to the interior this year include piano-black accents, an upgraded and surprisingly good infotainment system, and a few other bits of trim here and there. Sadly, soft-touch surfaces weren't among the changes, and the Mirage offers no padded elbow rest and no center armrest at all. The supportive seat padding and cloth suggest comfort, and the seat heaters are remarkably efficient, but the lousy seating position makes it hard to actually get comfortable. And there are cheap touches everywhere, like the Bluetooth microphone gracelessly tacked on top of the steering column, or the USB dongle hidden in the glove box.\u00a0 Exterior While we wouldn't call the 2017 Mirage ugly, it doesn't benefit from the cutesy charm of some other jellybean-like subcompacts. The styling changes for this year apply to the hatchback and sedan, with both getting a bigger grille with more chrome, and a more detailed lower bumper. The trunk gives the little car a more mature persona, and while it offers decent cargo space, the rear seats don't fold down for long objects like they do in the hatchback. The Mirage G4 is available in a few eye-catching colors, such as bright orange Infrared, or the purplish Wine Red of our test car. Notable Equipment Standard Equipment The basic 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 comes with air conditioning, tilt (but not telescoping) steering with electric assist, and power windows, doors and mirrors. Also standard is keyless entry with an alarm, a USB port, and a 4-speaker audio system. It's a little sparse, but not surprising considering the low base price. Safety features include hill-start assist, seven standard airbags, including a driver's-side knee airbag, and stability control. That of course is on top of the 1.2-liter 3-cylinder engine, which in base models is paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Optional Equipment Foremost among the options is the automatic transmission, which we recommend since the manual is hardly the best. Most options are available as standard equipment in the higher-level SE trim on sedans, or GT on the hatchback. They include a rearview camera, push-button ignition and entry, and the upgraded audio system that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Automatic climate control is also part of the upgraded models, but curiously a stand-alone navigation system isn't available; presumably Mitsubishi has decided whatever smartphone you're using will suffice. Also available on the SE\/GT models is cruise control and Bluetooth, both controlled through steering-wheel buttons.\u00a0 Under the Hood The only engine available in the 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 is a 1.2-liter 3-cylinder with a modest 78 horsepower, four more than last year. The engine's primary duty is saving fuel, and it does this admirably, offering up to 42 mpg on the highway and 35 mpg in the city, numbers we normally associate with hybrids. The downside is that this isn't the most elegant powertrain. The engine vibrates noticeably at idle -- although it's better than it was before -- and at full throttle it sings a raspy, groaning song that will discourage exploring the reach of the gas pedal. Unfortunately, even if you just want to keep up with traffic leaving a stoplight, you'll need to floor it, which of course hurts fuel economy. 1.2-liter inline-3 78 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 74 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 33\/40 mpg (manual, sedan) 33\/41 mpg (manual, hatchback), 35\/42 mpg (automatic, sedan), 37\/43 mpg (automatic, hatchback) Pricing Notes The lowest Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage is on the ES hatchback, which starts at about $14,000 including the $835 destination charge. The automatic transmission adds $1,200 to that price. The new G4 sedan starts at about $15,000 with a manual. A fully equipped Mirage G4 SE is automatic-only and starts at a little below $18,000. While those prices are low, they're also not much better than a variety of competitors, like the Nissan Versa or Honda Fit. No matter what you decide, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid; it's a good chance it's well below sticker. As for resale, the Mirage is not expected to hold its value particularly well.

Unfortunately, even if you just want to keep up with traffic leaving a stoplight, you'll need to floor it, which of course hurts fuel economy. 1.2-liter inline-3 78 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 74 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 33\/40 mpg (manual, sedan) 33\/41 mpg (manual, hatchback), 35\/42 mpg (automatic, sedan), 37\/43 mpg (automatic, hatchback) Pricing Notes The lowest Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage is on the ES hatchback, which starts at about $14,000 including the $835 destination charge. The automatic transmission adds $1,200 to that price. The new G4 sedan starts at about $15,000 with a manual. A fully equipped Mirage G4 SE is automatic-only and starts at a little below $18,000. While those prices are low, they're also not much better than a variety of competitors, like the Nissan Versa or Honda Fit.

        "raw_article_content": "Driving the Mirage G4 Driving Impressions Our 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 sedan exhibited a smooth ride and strong brakes. Unfortunately, the steering\u2019s on-center feel is so poor we physically had to...... return the wheel to center or run the risk of continuing in whichever direction the Mirage was last pointed. On rough pavement, the Mirage\u2019s suspension is quite bouncy and the car leans heavily even in moderate corners. Fuel economy is good so long as you\u2019re not in a hurry to get where you\u2019re going. Any sense of urgency, however, requires constant full-throttle maneuvers that quickly torpedo those rosy EPA numbers. The 1.2-liter 3-cylinder engine isn\u2019t big on power; with a mere 78 ponies it requires a leisurely 12.5 seconds to achieve 60 mph. The engine is also quite loud at full throttle, a fact exacerbated by the CVT automatic transmission that keeps the tachometer near redline anytime the engine is asked for peak performance. Favorite Features APPLE CARPLAY\/ANDROID AUTO A pleasant surprise in any subcompact, the 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage offers both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. With these apps, the audio system connects to your smartphone allowing you to access texts, maps and music all via the 6.5-inch touch screen. WARRANTY Similar to what Hyundai and Kia offer, Mitsubishi\u2019s 2018 Mirage and Mirage G4 subcompacts come with a 5-year\/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and a 10-year\/100,000-mile powertrain warranty at no extra cost. 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 Details Interior Improvements to the interior this year include a new touch-screen audio system, rearview camera and a relocated USB port. Sadly, soft-touch surfaces aren\u2019t among the positive, and the Mirage offers no padded elbow rest, although it does gain a driver\u2019s-side center armrest this year. The supportive seat padding and cloth suggest comfort, and the seat heaters are remarkably efficient, but the lousy seating position makes it hard to actually get comfortable. And there are cheap touches everywhere, like the Bluetooth microphone gracelessly tacked on top of the steering column. Exterior While we wouldn't call the 2018 Mirage ugly, it doesn't benefit from the cutesy charm of some other jelly-bean-like subcompacts. The hatchback and sedan feature a large chrome grille with a handsomely detailed lower bumper. The trunk gives the little car a more mature persona, and while it offers decent cargo space, the rear seats don't fold down as they do in the hatch, although there is a pass-through for longer objects. The Mirage G4 is available in a few eye-catching colors, such as bright orange Infrared, or the purplish Wine Red of our test car. Notable Equipment Standard Equipment The basic 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 comes with air conditioning, tilt (but not telescoping) steering wheel with controls for audio and Bluetooth, and power windows, doors and mirrors. Also standard is keyless entry with an alarm, a USB port, and a 4-speaker touch-screen audio system with rearview camera. It's a little sparse, but not surprising considering the low base price. Safety features include hill-start assist, seven standard airbags, including a driver's-side knee airbag, and stability control. That of course is on top of the 1.2-liter 3-cylinder engine, which in base models is paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Optional Equipment Foremost among the options is the automatic transmission, which we recommend since the manual is hardly the best. Most options are available as standard equipment in the higher-level SE trim on sedans, or GT on the hatchback. They include push-button ignition and entry, and the upgraded audio system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Automatic climate control is also part of the upgraded models, but curiously a stand-alone navigation system isn't available; presumably Mitsubishi has decided whatever smartphone you're using will suffice. Also available on the SE\/GT models is cruise control controlled through steering-wheel buttons. Under the Hood The only engine available in the 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage and Mirage G4 is a 1.2-liter 3-cylinder with a modest 78 horsepower. The engine's primary duty is saving fuel, and it does this admirably, offering up to 42 mpg on the highway and 35 mpg in the city, numbers we normally associate with hybrids. The downside is that this isn't the most elegant powertrain. The engine vibrates noticeably at idle -- although it's better than it was before -- and at full throttle it sings a raspy, groaning song that will discourage exploring the reach of the gas pedal. Unfortunately, even if you just want to keep up with traffic leaving a stoplight, you'll need to floor it, which of course hurts fuel economy. 1.2-liter inline-3 78 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm 74 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm EPA city\/highway fuel economy: 33\/40 mpg (manual, sedan) 33\/41 mpg (manual, hatchback), 35\/42 mpg (automatic, sedan), 37\/43 mpg (automatic, hatchback) Pricing Notes The lowest Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage is on the ES hatchback, which starts at about $14,260 including the $865 destination charge.
